# mvc-projen

The [projen](https://projen.io/) baseline for all [MV Consulting](https://manuel-vogel.de/) projects.

## Table of Contents

- [Features](#features)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Inspiration](#inspiration)

## Features
- 📏 **Best Practice and unified Setup**: All the scaffolders we need are in one place and tested. From `cdk-constructs` to later `clis` with [golang](https://go.dev/)
- 🏗️ **Extensibility**: Pass in customized options for the scaffolder templates

## Usage

```bash
# 1. create a new project directory 
mkdir my-new-construct &&  cd my-new-construct

# 2. set up the project using the projen new command
npx projen new --from @mavogel/mvc-projen@~0
```

By default this uses npm and a recent AWS CDK version; pass `--cdkVersion=x.y.z` or `--package-manager=<pnpm|yarn|...>` to override either.

## Inspiration
This project was created based on the following inspiration
- [taimos-projen](https://github.com/taimos/taimos-projen): code from [Thorsten Höger](https://www.taimos.de/) has always been an inspiration for my `cdk` and [projen](https://projen.io/) projects.
- [projen-cdk-hugo-pipeline](https://github.com/MV-Consulting/projen-cdk-hugo-pipeline/): a previous projen baseline we built, during which we learned a lot about the internal of projen. We could build up on this knowledge.
